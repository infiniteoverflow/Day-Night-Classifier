# Day-Night-Classifier
A Typical Day-Night Classifier implemented using OpenCV.

We classify images by considering their average brightness over the V layer after converting the image to HSV Color Space.

If the average brightness is above a certain threshold , we classify it as a Day Image.

Current Accuracy : 72%

**Scope of improvement :**
- Consider a better threshold to accurately classify images
- Better Architectures like using Neural Networks/CNN Layers
